# us-marathon-tax
A tax model that maximizes the number of citizens able to achieve the wealth limit.

# Introduction

The US tax law is complicated. Very complicated. It is so complicated that a company with a market cap of 62 billion dollars has a product to help people file their taxes. They make a lot of money on that product. They have competitors.

In the US there is no limit to how much you can be worth. In fact your worth can go so high that you would not notice if the average salary of the rest of the country dissappeared from your deposit accounts.

In the US there is no limit to how broke you can get. Some debts are not resolved by bankruptcy. Some companies will try to get you go sign a commitment to pay your deceased relatives debts.

On the other hand, the US is a democratic republic, formed as a Union by the people for the people. The language is dated, but all people in the US are considered equal. And the liberties and justice within the country apply to all.

These are contradictory. This repository is a proposed solution.

# Solution

Here I propose a set of principles that align with the founding of the nation that apply to sustainability of wealth. Opinions may differ on what to do with the tax revenue, but the principles affect where the tax comes from and how much. To summarize, I propose that a citizen is not taxed at the federal level for their direct labor, up to an amount adjusted for inflation. People are taxed for income they make that is derived from the efforts of others, because the Union is how they gained access to additional labor. The taxation for indirect income increases to create a net worth ceiling. The net worth ceiling is also adjusted for inflation. No individual in the United States shall possess a net worth in excess of the ceiling.

## Principles

1. The US is a Union for the betterment of its citizens.
1. If someone possesses an excess of wealth it prevents or slows others ability to gain wealth.
1. Your labor should benefit you.
1. Other's labor is accessible to you by was of the Union.
1. You may benefit from other's labor, but you did not create the product you collective produced without that labor.
1. No one should monopolize wealth.
1. The Union should strive to maximize the number of citizens at the net worth ceiling.
